# Vehicle Type Recognition using CNN and ElasticNet

## Project Background
In daily life, road traffic is filled with different types of vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles. However, identifying and distinguishing these vehicle types from images can be a complicated task, especially in scenarios such as traffic monitoring or vehicle density analysis. With the advancement of machine learning technology, we have the opportunity to develop solutions that can aid automation in vehicle type recognition.

## Project Dataset
Dataset name : `Vehicle-dataset`

Dataset source : [Kaggle - Vehicle Type Recognition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggleashwin/vehicle-type-recognition)

This is a vehicle image classification dataset containing images of four different types of vehicles: Car, Truck, Bus, and Motorcycle. The dataset is curated to help learners to develop and evaluate image classification models for identifying various vehicle types from images.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can distinguish between four categories of vehicles: cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and ElasticNet.
